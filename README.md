Agentic AI–Driven Career Guidance System



An Agentic AI–based career guidance platform that helps users identify the right career through continuous, real-world evaluation rather than one-time questionnaires. The system begins with an aptitude and interest assessment, shortlists potential career paths, and validates them using career-specific micro-challenges. By tracking user performance, behavior, decision-making style, and failure patterns, the agent either confirms the career and generates a personalized roadmap with timelines and guidance, or intelligently recommends a more suitable alternative. Anonymized failure data is continuously learned as collective intelligence to improve guidance for future users.
